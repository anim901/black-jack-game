# Blackjack Game - Python Project

## Overview
This project is a Python implementation of the classic card game **Blackjack**. It is an interactive, user-friendly program that follows the official rules of the game and provides a great way to practice logic and Python programming skills.

## Rules of the Game
1. The user is initially dealt **two cards**, while the system gets **one card**.
2. The user can draw additional cards until their total score is **less than 21**.
3. If the user's total score exceeds **21**, the system wins automatically.
4. The system draws cards until its total score is **at least 17**.
5. The winner is determined based on who has the **higher score**, provided neither exceeds 21.
6. If either the user or the system reaches a total score of **21** at any time, they win immediately.

## Features
- Replicates the original **Blackjack** gameplay with Python.
- **Interactive gameplay** where users can make decisions at every step.
- Uses **randomized card selection** for both the user and the system.
- Modular and easy-to-read code structure with separate functions for:
  - Selecting cards.
  - Calculating scores.
  - Managing gameplay (e.g., restarting or declaring results).
- Built for beginners to understand programming concepts like loops, functions, and conditional statements.

## Challenges Faced
- Ensuring the code remained **modular** and easy to manage for a beginner.
- Encountered a **bug** while handling game control logic, which required extensive debugging (commented in the code for reference).
- Balancing gameplay logic with user interactivity while adhering to **Blackjack rules**.

## Learnings
- Developed a strong understanding of Python control flow and functions through debugging.
- Improved skills in **structuring large programs** by breaking down logic into separate, reusable functions.
- Gained resilience and problem-solving skills by resolving complex bugs.
- Strengthened foundational concepts in loops, conditional statements, and modular programming.
